# .agents

Maintained by [Fred Oliveira](https://x.com/f).

This is a set of custom skills and agent files for AI agents like Pi, Claude Code, or Codex. Many of them manage my Obsidian vault, because that's fundamental to my workflow.

## Installation

- Clone this repository somewhere
- Read (please, *always read install scripts*), customize, and run `./install.sh` to symlink these to your agent folders
- Share your own skills if you have them!

## Obsidian skills

These are relatively specific to the inner workings of my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault, but you may find them useful too. Probably pretty quick to adapt if your vault is relatively close to [@kepano](https://x.com/kepano)'s [vault template](https://github.com/kepano/kepano-obsidian).
